Algorithm says: "Okay, I guess you don't want to be shown."<br><br>2️⃣ TALKING TO EVERYONE (which means NO ONE)<br>"We have something for everyone!" Translation: You have nothing specific for anyone.<br><br>3️⃣ LOOKING AMATEUR<br>Phone screenshot menus. Blurry product photos. Generic "Check DM for price." Customers scroll past.<br><br>4️⃣ ZERO SEO<br>Beautiful Instagram, but Google "bakery in Westlands"? You're nowhere.<br><br>Zinara fixes ALL of this:<br>✅ We post consistently (your algorithm loves us)<br>✅ We message specifically (your ideal customer feels SEEN)<br>✅ We design professionally (you look like the expert you are)<br>✅ We optimize for search (Google knows you exist)<br><br>Visibility isn't magic.
